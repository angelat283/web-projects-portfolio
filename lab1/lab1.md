# Reflection for Lab 1
Working on Lab 1 was my first real chance to play with Python. I like how the code feels cleaner compared to C/C++ — no semicolons, no extra brackets, just straight to the point. It honestly makes writing functions faster. The indentation rules are nice for readability, but at the same time they can be a little annoying because one wrong space breaks the program.

What surprised me the most is how Python doesn’t force me to declare variable types. At first it felt strange because I’m used to C/C++ where you have to be very clear about int, double, or char. In Python, I just write the variable and it works, but it also means I need to keep track mentally of what type I’m using.

Overall, Python and C/C++ share the same basics like loops, functions, and classes, but Python hides a lot of the low-level stuff. C/C++ makes me think about memory and performance, while Python lets me focus on just solving the problem. I’d say Python is faster to write in, but C/C++ gives me more control.
